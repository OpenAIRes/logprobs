# logprobs

This repository contains `logprobs.json`, a sample JSON response from the OpenAI
Chat Completion API. The data was generated by calling the API with the
`logprobs` parameter enabled (set to 5) so that token-level probabilities would
be returned.

The included response captures the assistant's greeting, "Hi! How can I help you
today?". Each token in the message lists its log probability along with the top
alternative tokens proposed by the model.

Such data is useful for inspecting how confidently the model selects words or
for building visualizations of the decoding process.

## Exploring the data

* `logprobs.html` – An interactive table that loads `logprobs.json` and lets you
  click each token to reveal its top alternative tokens and their log
  probabilities.
* `parse_logprobs.py` – A small command-line parser that prints the tokens and
  their probabilities. Run `python parse_logprobs.py --help` for options.
