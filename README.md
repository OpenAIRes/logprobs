# logprobs

A small collection of utilities for working with log probabilities from
language models. The project aims to make it easy to compute token-level
log probabilities, aggregate them across sequences, and visualize the
results.

Planned features include:

- Simple APIs for obtaining log probabilities from various model back ends
- Tools for aggregating and inspecting log probability distributions
- Helper functions for integrating log probability calculations into other
  Python projects

This repository is in an early stage, so the interface may evolve as new
use cases arise.
