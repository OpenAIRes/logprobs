# logprobs

This repository contains `logprobs.json`, a sample JSON response from the OpenAI Chat Completion API. The data was generated by calling the API with the `logprobs` parameter enabled (set to 5) so that token-level probabilities would be returned.

The included response captures the assistant's greeting, "Hi! How can I help you today?". Each token in the message lists its log probability along with the top alternative tokens proposed by the model.

Such data is useful for inspecting how confidently the model selects words or for building visualizations of the decoding process. The empty `logprobs.html` file is a placeholder for a potential visualization of this output.
